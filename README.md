# My personal nvim configuration

I made this public so I can easily clone without authentication,  
but since I treat this as a personal use only stuff,  
there can be some(read "a lot of") messy stuff.
  
Much of this might have been selectively copy pasted from plugin repos.
Those repos are obviously listed in plugin setup part.
